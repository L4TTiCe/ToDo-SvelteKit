# Intel 2022 - GPU Software Development Intern

## Task

Implement a simple full stack application for “TODO list management” that would satisfy the following:

- User of your application should be able to store, modify, delete TODO list and optionally mark them with a deadline timestamp.
- User should be able to retrieve TODO list based on created timestamp, deadline timestamp with sorting.

**Note:**
The application should be a full stack application. Implement API endpoints, DB schema and add a simple User Interface for interaction. Add documentation as needed on how to use your UI and APIs.
